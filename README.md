## About Me
Hey! My name is **Rania** and I'm currently enrolled in the _CFGDegree Full stack programme_. I will be joining Dunnhumby on the InfoSec team in September. I have coded independently previously, but I am really excited now to have the opportunity to work collaboratively on group projects.

### Purpose of this repository
This repository will be used for sumbitting assignments and projects for my CFGDegree. This specific assignment focuses on good use of Git and Github and using good coding practices.
